    "description": "'ECONOMIC_CORROSION' transforms 37 years of economic data into a mechanical ballet, where motors and valves dance to the rhythm of income, house prices, and living costs, creating a mesmerizing visual narrative.",
    "paragraph": [
      "In a world where data drives decisions, 'ECONOMIC_CORROSION' stands as an artistic rendition of numeric truths. It's not just a statistical compilation; it's a visual, mechanical exploration that brings to life 37 years of economic fluctuations. Through the precise synchronization of motors and valves, this artwork embodies the heartbeat of UK economy, reflecting the intertwining of income, house prices, and the cost of living.",
      "The creation of this unique piece required meticulous planning, interpretation, and artistic finesse. Historical data was translated into a dynamic performance, each number finding its rhythm and pace. The process involved defining parameters for motor speed and valve activation to mirror the economic trends of each year. As the sculpture dances through time, its movements capture the economic nuances, telling a story that goes beyond mere digits and graphs.",
      "The technological backbone of this artwork consists of three motors controlled by an Arduino, representing different data sets. Using real data from 1986 to 2022, the motors' speed is manipulated to reflect the corresponding values, creating a visual representation of the economic landscape. The unique integration of mechanical engineering with programming ensures that every turn, every whirl of the motors is a carefully calculated step in this numeric dance.",
      "The theoretical underpinning of 'ECONOMIC_CORROSION' lies in the intersection of art, economics, and technology. By converting hard data into movement and rhythm, the piece aims to present a more tactile and emotive perspective on statistical figures that often remain abstract to the general populace. It challenges the viewer to perceive the fluctuations in the economy as a living, breathing entity, reflecting both the cyclical nature of financial trends and the inherent dynamism of a system constantly in flux. This artwork serves not only as a representation of data but as a commentary on how we engage with and interpret information in the modern world, questioning our connection to the figures that shape our lives.",
      "'ECONOMIC_CORROSION' is more than an art piece; it's a timeless ode to our collective economic journey. By marrying data with mechanical design, it serves as a reminder of how numbers shape our world and influence our lives. It's a celebration of human ingenuity, a tribute to our resilience and adaptability. As the gears continue to turn and the valves open and close, the dance goes on, mirroring life's constant ebb and flow. This artwork stands as an eloquent symbol of how creativity can breathe life into the mundane, transforming numbers into an experience to be felt and appreciated."

    "paragraph": [
      "How Shall We Begin Again? is a collective action. Each person involved is invited to contribute twelve pieces of music of which three are randomly selected and played for them in no particular order. This live installation is about returning to the body, returning to ourselves. Each person interprets this opportunity. Taking up space, being seen, being present and for some it’s simply about liveness: the act of being in the moment. Across the two days of the performance, nothing repeats. Audience members are invited to book a ticket for the time they want to arrive and then stay as long as they like.",
      "My contribution to the project involves the synchronization of data between two high-tech sensors: the Ant Neuro EEG headset and a breathing belt, both connected to a tablet, and Pupil Labs' invisible glasses that track eye movements. The software was written in Python and designed to be modular, accommodating people entering and exiting the performance space. Communication with the EEG headset and breathing belt was achieved via LSL, while the eye-tracking glasses were accessed through an API. A significant challenge was managing threading, with constant messages sent to every device at 5-second intervals and additional messages sent to mark new songs played by the DJ. The project also includes the development of a data visualization website using React, Material-UI, and D3.js.",
      "The core objective of the project was to create a precise and efficient system for synchronizing data between different sensory devices, specifically in the context of tracking performance and facilitating synchronization between the EEG and Pupil Labs datasets. By developing a system that can handle real-time data from multiple sources, the project aims to provide valuable insights into human performance and behavior. The inclusion of a DJ's song data adds an additional layer of complexity, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between auditory stimuli and physiological responses.",
      "The project represents a significant achievement in the field of real-time data synchronization and analysis, particularly for a developer with limited coding experience. Under the guidance of Jamie Ward, the system was developed in just two months, working two days a week. The next steps include automating the synchronization of the EEG and Pupil Labs datasets and enhancing the data visualization website. The project's success demonstrates the potential for integrating various sensory data to create a comprehensive understanding of human performance and offers a promising foundation for future research and development in this area.

      "Mechanicus is a physical representation of the unsustainable control an individual can exert over multiple companies through stock investment. It's a self-destructing machine that interprets live stock data, activating 25 modules of servo motors and gearing systems to reflect stock changes. The project highlights the fragility and eventual collapse of a system driven solely by profit",
      "Inspired by research in mass psychology, macroeconomics, and geo-politics, Mechanicus aims to expose the intricate workings of our economic system. It emphasizes how a single human's control over multiple corporations, driven only by profit, is unsustainable. The project symbolizes how this greed-driven approach neglects customer needs, employee well-being, and environmental sustainability.",
      "The installation consists of a mechanical sculpture and a screen displaying stock portfolio information. Data is extracted from the iexcloud API, and the mechanical parts are made of wood to symbolize the wear and tear on employees. Each module uses two servo motors to create rotating and actuation motion, representing a corporation. The communication system uses modbus via RS485 cable, and the power distribution reflects the economic theory of information scarcity.",
      "Mechanicus illustrates how the system's slow destruction mirrors the degradation of our world system. The project faced challenges such as voltage reduction, information overload, and wear and tear, which further emphasized the theme of collapse.",
