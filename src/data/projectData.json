    "paragraph": [
      "How Shall We Begin Again? is a collective action. Each person involved is invited to contribute twelve pieces of music of which three are randomly selected and played for them in no particular order. This live installation is about returning to the body, returning to ourselves. Each person interprets this opportunity. Taking up space, being seen, being present and for some it’s simply about liveness: the act of being in the moment. Across the two days of the performance, nothing repeats. Audience members are invited to book a ticket for the time they want to arrive and then stay as long as they like.",
      "My contribution to the project involves the synchronization of data between two high-tech sensors: the Ant Neuro EEG headset and a breathing belt, both connected to a tablet, and Pupil Labs' invisible glasses that track eye movements. The software was written in Python and designed to be modular, accommodating people entering and exiting the performance space. Communication with the EEG headset and breathing belt was achieved via LSL, while the eye-tracking glasses were accessed through an API. A significant challenge was managing threading, with constant messages sent to every device at 5-second intervals and additional messages sent to mark new songs played by the DJ. The project also includes the development of a data visualization website using React, Material-UI, and D3.js.",
      "The core objective of the project was to create a precise and efficient system for synchronizing data between different sensory devices, specifically in the context of tracking performance and facilitating synchronization between the EEG and Pupil Labs datasets. By developing a system that can handle real-time data from multiple sources, the project aims to provide valuable insights into human performance and behavior. The inclusion of a DJ's song data adds an additional layer of complexity, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between auditory stimuli and physiological responses.",
      "The project represents a significant achievement in the field of real-time data synchronization and analysis, particularly for a developer with limited coding experience. Under the guidance of Jamie Ward, the system was developed in just two months, working two days a week. The next steps include automating the synchronization of the EEG and Pupil Labs datasets and enhancing the data visualization website. The project's success demonstrates the potential for integrating various sensory data to create a comprehensive understanding of human performance and offers a promising foundation for future research and development in this area.

    "description": "",
    "paragraph": [
      "We live in a revolutionary time, where the masses are rising against an aging political regime and rising inequality. The downfall of social benefit coincides with the rising of the elite class, as a direct result of the establishment of global neoliberalism policy. From the Oxfam 2017 report, we see that just 8 men own 50% of the world's wealth, which sounds awfully like a monarchy to me. Except that this time they made an improvement to flee the guillotine. Indeed, the installation of democracy brought a golden chance to bring forth a scapegoat.",
      "« In 1965, the German philosopher Herbert Marcuse coined a term for the contradictory system that forbids citizens from becoming involved in politics but at the same time allows them free rein in cultural activities and in opinion-forming, Marcuse referred to it as “repressive tolerance. » -A Brief History of the Masses",
      "Nowadays, we are starting to see a global interest, from the masses, in politics, to bring forth a reform of our capitalist global system. The interest takes from manifestations against their government, taking place around the world: Hong Kong, Barcelona, Lebanon, Indonesia, Baghdad, Venezuela, Algeria, Sudan, Iran, France, etc. Thus, I want to bring forth the concept of democracy as it was originally envisioned during the III republic in France.",
      "My first motivation was the « Gilet Jaune » movement in France. For me, it is very revealing when a country that is known to have the interest of its people at the forefront of their political ideology would now fight against « Le President des Riches ». There the citizen is fighting against the 111% rise of the energy taxes following the privatization of « Gas de France », which means they now have trouble heating themselves in winter. They also after better working conditions, as most of them are forced to work two to three part-time jobs with all the precarity it brings forth.",
      "For a country that brought us democracy and seeing the state it is in, I think it is important to go back to the source. For this reason, I decided to represent the incorruptible Maximilien Robespierre as he was furiously against the monarchy. More precisely, I interpreted his posture, seeing as he welcomes democracy with all his heart, from master Neo-classic painter Jacques-Louis David, in his piece « The Tennis Court Oath ». I chose this piece since it is a key event in the constitution of democratic and resonates with the ongoing manifestation in France as a highly illegal gathering. Therefore, I transposed Robespierre's position from the painting into an avant-garde style sculpture. To keep the concept actual and in correlation with history, I did not include his head since it’s in a box due to a close guillotine shave. Interestingly enough, the dismemberment coincides with the gradual dismantlement of social security in France.",
      "Echoing the vast global movement, toward popular manifestation against their respective political parties, I made the work in multiple pieces. The different individual pieces slide into one another creating a sturdy entity that elevates the power of the masses into a physical form. Much like Jacques-Louis David's research attempting to represent the power of the masses where he first started by representing the many (« The Tennis Court Oath ») but quickly realized that taking a key figure was the way to go (« The Death of Marat »), I bring back Robespierre, therefore, remembering what democracy originally meant."
